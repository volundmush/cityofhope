# Conversion from TinyMUX to RhostMUSH
Because I'm an idiot and this is a very tedious process, I'm writing down all of the stuff that needs to be done in order to convert the game.

## Step ??: Install RhostMUSH

## Step ??: Copy files.
Copy the Server folder in this repository into your rhost directory and merge the contents. Overwrite whatever needs to be overwritten.

## Step ??: Configure Rhost Hardcode
`make confsource` requires Read Mux Passswds and the other things in my softcode repo.

## Step ??: Convert the Database
`cd ~/rhost/Server/convert`
`./doconvert.sh cityofhope.FLAT rhost.out`

(version TinyMUX 2.9+, defaults Y for everything)

The converter will also create a file called `muxlocks.out`. Take note of this for later.

## Step ??: Load the Database

`cd ~/rhost/Server/game`
`./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm ~/rhost/Server/convert/rhost.out data/netrhost.db.new`

## Step ??: .conf files
Open up `rhost/Server/game/netrhost.conf` in your favorite editor and scroll through, making sure everything is set up correctly. Set up your port, mud name, etc.

At the bottom add this line:
```
include cityofhope.conf
```

cityofhope.conf also includes muxalias.conf so no need to add that a second time.

It is, alternatively, highly recommended that you create something like a `mygame.conf` which will `include cityofhope.conf` and include your game-specific changes to rhost settings and etc.

## Step ??: Promote Sponge
```
@set *sponge=IMMORTAL !ROYALTY
```

## Step ??: Locks
'''
@cmdquota me=99999
'''
Paste in the muxlocks file generated by the converter.

## Step ??: Myrddin's MUSHCron
Get latest CRON from [here](https://bitbucket.org/myrddin0/myrddins-mush-code/src/master/Myrddin's%20mushcron/v1.1.0/mushcron.v110.code) and install it in the master room to update existing Cron.


## Step ??: Myrddin's BBS

## Step ??: Update Anomaly Jobs
STill writing this...

## Step ??: Install Help System.
Paste in Help System.txt to install support for the +help, +jhelp etc
